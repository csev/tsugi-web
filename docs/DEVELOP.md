Developing TSUGI Tools
======================

There are two ways to use the Tsugi library/framework:

* You can build a "Tsugi Module" from scratch following all of the
Tsugi style guidance, using the Tsugi browser environment, and
making full use of the Tsugi framework.
We have starter code for
[Bulding a Tsugi Module](https://github.com/csev/tsugi-php-module)

* You can use Tsugi more like a library and add it to an existing
application.   We have example code showing how you might
[Use Tsugi With an Existing Application](https://github.com/csev/tsugi-php-standalone)

Both of these approaches depend on the
[Tsugi Devloper/Admin Console](https://github.com/csev/tsugi)
for database configuration, setup, developer test harness,
CASA support, Content Item Support, etc.

Documentation
=============

Here is a video tutorial that covers the _mod/attend_ Tsugi tool:

This page is a work in progress as more documentation is developed but
for now this is the documentation I have:

* [TSUGI API Documentation](http://do1.dr-chuck.com/tsugi/phpdoc/)
* [Coding Standards](CODING.md)
* [Video: TSUGI Data Model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXdNQGuXvuo&list=PLlRFEj9H3Oj5WZUjVjTJVBN18ozYSWMhw&index=4)
* [Internationalizing and Localizing](I18N.md)
* [Notes on generating API Documentation using PhpDoc](PHPDOC.md)
