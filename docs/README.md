TSUGI - A Framework for Building PHP-Based Learning Tools
=========================================================

**Note:** As of April 20, 2016 - I am refactoring much of the tool and library code in 
this repository into distinct repositories.  I made an 0.2.0 branch that captured 
the state of the repository before non-upwards compatible changes started.
Please join the 
[Tsugi Developer List](https://groups.google.com/a/apereo.org/forum/#!forum/tsugi-dev)
so I can inform you when changes are being done.

Welcome to the www.tsugi.org project. 
Its goal is to build a scalable multi-tenant "tool" hosting environment based on the 
emerging IMS standards.

Here are some documentation pages for this project:

* [Installing Tsugi](docs/INSTALL.md)
* [Developing Tsugi Applications](docs/DEVELOP.md)
* [About The Project](docs/ABOUT.md)

If you want to see this code actually working, you can play online:

You can log in to this site and request an account to use with your IMS
LTI compatible LMS.  Once you have a key/secret to use the system, here
is some LTI 1.0 documentation:

There is also a very pre-emergent effort to port Tsugi to Node.js:
