While we can work on anything we like, here are a few ideas I have:

- Build a Caliper implementation for one or more of the versions (PHP, Java, or Node)
- Clean up the Documentation - lots of methods in PHP are still not 
documented - this is a lot of easy commits / PRs to get folks started
- Add grade return to the Node and/or Java versions
- Build a Python version of Tsugi
- Build a brand new tool - like a threaded discussion - 
maybe in PHP, maybe in Node - maybe both :)

In terms of getting started - installing the Tsugi developer/management 
console is a good start:

https://github.com/csev/tsugi/blob/master/docs/DEVELOP.md

Perhaps play with the exercises:

Then adding the Java or Node versions:

Even more advanced folks can run the cross-language functionality test:
